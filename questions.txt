RPC URL for ethereum mainnet seems to be pretty generic.
My understanding:
1) All providers send their transaction to this URL
2) All nodes in the network do a API call to this network to fetch all the transactions received.
3) But isn't this centralized ? Then whats the purpose of exposing your own RPC URL ?

When deploying contract using ether.js, only Private Key was passed
How did the blockchain identify the public key associated ?
